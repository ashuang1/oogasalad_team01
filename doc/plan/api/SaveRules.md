# SaveRules

## Overview

The SaveRules API is designed to provide a robust mechanism for saving edited rules from the authoring environment to the configuration file when editing these in the authoring environment

## SOLID / Object Oriented Design

- Single Responsibility Principle  
  - Each component focuses on a specific aspect of rule saving  
- Open-Closed Principle  
  - Designed to be extensible through abstract classes and interfaces  
- Dependency Inversion  
  - Relies on abstractions to facilitate future modifications and integrations

## Classes

**public interface RuleSaveManager\<Type extends BaseRule\>**

**String saveRule(T rule) throws RuleSaveException**

- Saves a single rule to the configuration file  
- Returns a unique identifier for the saved rule

**Optional\<T\> loadRule(String ruleId) throws RuleLoadException**

- Retrieves a specific rule by its identifier

**Boolean updateRule(String ruleId, T updatedRule) throws RuleUpdateException**

- Updates an existing rule in the configuration file

**Boolean deleteRule(String ruleId) throws RuleDeletionException**

- Removes a specific rule from the configuration file

**public interface RuleStorageProvider**

**void write(String key, String ruleData) throws StorageException**

- Writes rule data to the storage mechanism


  
**String read(String key) throws StorageException**

- Reads rule data from the storage mechanism

**Boolean delete(String key) throws StorageException**

- Deletes a specific rule from storage

## Custom Exceptions

**public class RuleSaveException extends Exception**

- Thrown when an error occurs during rule saving

**public class RuleLoadException extends Exception**

- Thrown when an error occurs while loading a rule

**public class RuleUpdateException extends Exception**

- Thrown when an error occurs during rule update

**public class RuleDeletionException extends Exception**

- Thrown when an error occurs during rule deletion

**public class StorageException extends Exception**

- Thrown for general storage-related errors

## Details / Use Cases

- AUTH-13: Load Level from Configuration  
- AUTH-14: Save Level Configuration  
- AUTH-15: Modify Existing Configuration File  
- AUTH-16: Modify Author Name  
- AUTH-17: Modify Level Title  
- AUTH-18: Modify Level Description

## Considerations

The SaveRules API is designed with extensibility and future improvements in mind. Potential enhancements include:

- Advanced error recovery and detailed logging mechanisms  
- Improved performance for large-scale rule management  
- Implement input validation for all rule data  
- Implement appropriate access controls
