# Sprint Milestone

We will use GitLab Issues to track our progress and prioritize features for each sprint. This document will highlight the individual responsibilities. We will upload all the use cases at the beginning of the sprint and assign them to their respective team members. We will set weights to each GitLab issue to represent their priority. Finally, we use the Issues Board and Milestones features of GitLab to track our progress on a specific sprint.
