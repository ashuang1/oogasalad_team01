* Timer modeâ€“ you should try to survive for the longest time
* You are a wall, blocking Pac-Man so it gets eaten as soon as possible
* fastest death
* You can jump through walls or ghosts can jump through walls.
* Hunter and gather (Pac-Farmer): Idle game. You can collect different crops and sell them. As you sell them you can improve the crop yield, and create robots to farm for you.
