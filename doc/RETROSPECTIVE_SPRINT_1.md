## Stand Up Meeting

### Ishan Madan

* Absent from the team meeting/lab due to a family emergency.

### Owen Jennings

* Work done this Sprint  
  * I began the week working on View elements such as theme handling and language configuration.  
  * On the model side, I worked on implementing our game map model and API. After completing the model, I worked on displaying the game map in the view.

* Plan for next Sprint?  
  * I plan to write more tests and ensure that I test with every new feature.  
  * I hope to improve how we load the different collision strategies from configuration files.  
  * I also want to use some more java features like reflection to remove hard coded switch statements in our code.

* Blockers/Issues in your way  
  * Need to finalize the design of our configuration files and how we want to assign specific strategy design patterns to the entities in authoring environment.

 

### Jessica Chen

* Work done this Sprint  
  * The work I did for this sprint was mainly working through setting up the initial Ghost path finding strategies and the Ghost movement

* Plan for next Sprint?  
  * Write more tests for current features and new features  
  * Configuration File Restructuring with Different Ghost Movement

* Blockers/Issues in your way  
  * I don’t think so

 

### Angela Predolac

*  Work done this Sprint  
  * I initially started out working on view for authoring environment, so I completed the EntitySelectorView class. However, due to JavaFX issues on my computer, I then switched to model for authoring environment, writing the AuthoringModel and EntityPlacement classes and the corresponding tests.

* Plan for next Sprint?  
  * I plan to continue working on authoring environment model and view now that my JavaFX is resolved. I also plan to be more involved in refactoring.

* Blockers/Issues in your way  
  * None as of now.

 

### William He

* Work done this Sprint  
  * I worked on Authoring Environment view as well as the all the Config stuff. Worked on a lot of brainstorming for the data file structure. Also did a refactor to make EntityType and EntityPlacement rather than just EntityData.

* Plan for next Sprint?  
  * Work on authoring environment and add more testing

* Blockers/Issues in your way  
  * N/A

### Luke Fu

* Work done this Sprint  
  * Implementing map generation and creation of wall and dot sprites. Created framework for “GameState” which helps manage the values in the game for future saving features and game statistics.

* Plan for next Sprint?  
  * Working on implementing levels, pause view, more HUD features, and different modes for already-created and sprites

* Blockers/Issues in your way  
  *  Further development in the config file

### Austin Huang

* Work done this Sprint  
  * Implemented strategy interface and concrete implementations for collisions and game outcomes and integrating into game player code

* Plan for next Sprint?  
  * Implement effect strategies for powerups, work on integrating strategies into game player code

* Blockers/Issues in your way  
  * N/A

 

### Troy Ludwig

* Work done this Sprint  
  * Implemented user control for any entity  
  * Added tunnel functionality/edge wrapping

* Plan for next Sprint?  
  * Update sprites and animations  
  * Add more user control options

* Blockers/Issues in your way  
  * N/A

 

## Project's current progress

* The project is going well. We hope to start adding extension features and finalizing the basic functionality of our program.

## Current level of communication

* Good use of meetings and text communication. We could improve the amount of in person communication and pair programming.

## Satisfaction with team roles

* Most people are satisfied, and some people want more.   
* We hope to improve the division of tasks and hold individuals accountable for work.

## Teamwork that worked well

* Thing \#1  
  * Active group chat for communication of progress and issues

* Thing \#2  
  * Planned and unplanned team meetings to discuss issues

## Teamwork that could be improved

* Thing \#1  
  * Work continuously through the week

* Thing \#2  
  * Be punctual with work so others are not blocked and feel they need to complete tasks themselves

## Teamwork to improve next Sprint

- Having more specific deadlines. Holding individuals compatible for their contribution.
