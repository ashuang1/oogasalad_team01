* Preferred channel of communication
    * Zoom and in-person meetings on Monday

    * Close your tickets and Gitlab issues. (actually close your issues)
        * make sure all gitlab issues are assigned
    * Everyone should have their branch they merge to. You can have a feature branch for every feature or an individual branch.
        * Make sure you delete your branches.
    * Whenever someone merges to main DO NOT BREAK the pipeline. You meaningful commits.
        * DO NOT MERGE INTO MAIN IF PIPELINE IS BROKEN
    * Aim to have all major core features completed 24 hours before the deadline.

### Meetings

* How to communicate action items made during the meeting
    * Monday meetings checkin for what they did (stand up) and what else to do.
    * Thursday: we can make the issues and assign them to the people for next weeks sprint.
* Policy for a team member to give advance notice of missing a team meeting and work required to make up for it
    * If you can’t make a meeting, text in the group chat 24 hours before
* Policy for handling disagreements, major decisions, or priorities during the meeting
    * Democracy (majority rule).

### Communications

* Decision-making policy (e.g., by consensus? by majority vote?)
    * When there is a contentious issue, we will hold a discussion and conclude with a vote. The majority vote will be the decision we make.
* Response policy (e.g., respond within 24 hours)
    * You should respond to text messages within 24 hours and be timely to meetings.
        * If you don’t know, say you don’t know.
    * Don’t mute the group chat.
    * If you get a direct message, answer within the day and do not ignore it.
* Policy for keeping everyone up-to-date on major decisions, changes, or updates
    * If you have a major decision/update send a detailed thought doc.
    * Whenever editing someone else's code while they are also working on it, suggest pair programming or notify them by text to avoid merge conflicts.
    * Google doc for easy checking on if things are done.

### Commitments

* What does it mean to work to the "best of your ability"
    * Do your tasks, do what you say you want to do. If you can’t do something, say it, don’t lie.
* How to set internal deadlines
    * We will assign Gitlab issues to everyone at the beginning of the week.
    * We will agree on which features should be implemented during each sprint.
    * Try to set a due date before the Monday meeting, so then the Monday meeting week can work on finishing up those loose ends.
* How to provide commitments others on the team can rely on
    * Prioritize tasks that block other people's tasks.
* Policy for resolving failure to meet commitments
    * Try reaching out first, and if it persists go to Duvall (2 warning system).
    * If you have a busy week you can request fewer issues for one week and take more issues the following week.
    * Have the majority of features for the week finished on Monday so that you can be prepared for our stand-up meeting on Monday.

    * Communicate in the group chat, notify group of busy weeks beforehand
* Responses to team member asking for help
