WELCOME_TITLE=Welcome to the Game Authoring Environment
WELCOME_CONTENT=This help guide will walk you through the main features of the authoring environment and how to create your own games.
OVERVIEW_TITLE=Overview
OVERVIEW_CONTENT=The Game Authoring Environment allows you to create 2D games without writing code. Key features include:\n\n- Entity-based game design\n- Visual level editor\n- Collision rule system\n- Mode-based entity state management\n- Configurable win and lose conditions
INTERFACE_TITLE=Main Interface
INTERFACE_CONTENT=The authoring environment consists of these main areas:\n\n1. Canvas (center) - Where you place game entities\n2. Entity Selector (right) - Contains available entity types\n3. Entity Editor (right) - Configure entity properties\n4. Level Selector (left) - Manage game levels\n5. Level Settings (left) - Configure level properties\n6. Game Settings (bottom) - Configure global game settings
CANVAS_TITLE=Canvas View
CANVAS_CONTENT=The Canvas is where you design your game levels by placing entities:\n\n- Drag entities from the Entity Selector onto the canvas\n- Click on placed entities to select and edit them\n- Right-click on the canvas for additional options\n- Delete key removes selected entities\n- The grid helps you align entities precisely
ENTITY_TITLE=Entity System
ENTITY_CONTENT=Entities are the building blocks of your game:\n\n- Create new entity types using the '+ Add Entity Type' button\n- Entity types can have multiple modes (states) with different appearances and behaviors\n- Configure movement speed, controls, and other properties\n- Place instances of entity types on the canvas to build your level
ENTITY_EDITOR_TITLE=Entity Editor
ENTITY_EDITOR_CONTENT=The Entity Editor appears when you click on an entity type:\n\n- Change the entity name\n- Add new modes (different states like 'Default', 'Powered', etc.)\n- Set movement speed\n- Choose sprite images for each mode\n- Configure control settings (player-controlled or not)
LEVEL_SYSTEM_TITLE=Level System
LEVEL_SYSTEM_CONTENT=The Level System lets you create and manage multiple game levels:\n\n- Add new levels with the 'Add Level' button\n- Switch between levels using the dropdown\n- Configure level dimensions (width and height)\n- Set up mode change events triggered during gameplay\n- Configure entity spawn events based on conditions
COLLISION_RULES_TITLE=Collision Rules
COLLISION_RULES_CONTENT=Collision Rules define what happens when entities interact:\n\n- Access from the Game Settings panel ('Collision Rules' button)\n- Define rules between pairs of entity types\n- Set actions for each entity involved (destroy, add points, change mode, etc.)\n- Mode-specific rules allow for different behaviors in different states
GAME_SETTINGS_TITLE=Game Settings
GAME_SETTINGS_CONTENT=Game Settings control global game properties:\n\n- Set game title, author, and description\n- Configure overall game speed\n- Set starting lives and initial score\n- Choose score strategy (how points accumulate)\n- Define win and lose conditions
FIRST_GAME_TITLE=Creating Your First Game
FIRST_GAME_CONTENT=Basic steps to create a simple game:\n\n1. Create entity types (player, enemies, collectibles, obstacles)\n2. Configure their appearance and properties\n3. Set up collision rules between them\n4. Place entities on the canvas to design levels\n5. Configure win/lose conditions\n6. Save your game and test it in the Engine
TIPS_AND_TRICKS_TITLE=Tips and Tricks
TIPS_AND_TRICKS_CONTENT=Helpful tips for efficient game authoring:\n\n- Use meaningful names for entity types and levels\n- Start with a simple game to learn the basics\n- Test your game frequently during development\n- Create reusable entity types to save time\n- Use right-click context menus for quick actions\n- Save your work often!
CONCLUSION_TITLE=Ready to Create!
CONCLUSION_CONTENT=You now know the basics of the Game Authoring Environment!\n\nRemember that game development is an iterative process. Start simple, test often, and gradually add complexity as you become more comfortable with the tools.\n\nHappy game creating!
