/**
 * Contains the primary user interface components for the game authoring environment.
 * <p>
 * This package serves as the entry point for the view layer and includes subpackages responsible
 * for canvas interaction, configuration dialogs, control panels, settings views, and UI utilities.
 * These components collectively enable users to visually build and edit game configurations.
 * <p>
 * Responsibilities include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Rendering the main authoring interface</li>
 *   <li>Delegating functionality to specialized subviews (e.g., canvas, settings, selectors)</li>
 *   <li>Providing interactive controls for game design</li>
 *   <li>Synchronizing with controller and model layers</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The view layer follows MVC design principles and uses JavaFX to present a responsive, modular editing environment.
